                      In this experiment, you will be asked to explore a corpus of documents and write a summary about it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      You will first explore the corpus using an interface that we have designed. 
                      You can think of this interface as a kind of search engine. 
                      But instead of typing in your own queries, 
                      you select from pre-specified “topics” as recommended queries. 
                      By sequentially selecting from these topics, you can zoom in on different parts of the corpus, 
                      eventually reaching a single document. 
                      Instructions on how to use the interface can be found by hovering over the info icon 
                      on the top right of the interface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      After the exploration phase, you will be asked to write a summary. 
                      The quality of your summary will be assessed in real-time.
                      When the quality passes a certain threshold, you will be able to submit the HIT. 
                      Therefore, please try to get a good sense of the corpus during the exploration phase.

                      <p>This is an interface for you to explore a news corpus with 500 documents. 
                      The corpus is partitioned into topics.
                      You can access individual documents by selecting topics in rounds in the <b>Topics of Current Round</b> panel and 
                      see a record of it in the <b>Topics Selected</b> panel. 
                      At each round, you can also query documents in the <b>Document</b> panel.
                      The goal of this interface is to help you explore and be familiarize with the content of the corpus without 
                      needing to read through too many documents. 
                      You may proceed to the next phase after meeting certain criteria
                      (hover over the <b>status</b> icon to see your status and the criteria).
                      After this exploration phase, you will be asked to write a summary of the corpus.

                      <h5>Topics Selected:</h5>
                        <p>This panel shows the topics that you have selected on each round.
                        Different choices in different rounds will lead you to different documents. 
                        You can see all the topics for a round by hovering over the block for that round. 
                        You can also click on a previous round to go back to that round.
                        </p>
                      <h5>Topics of Current Round:</h5>
                        <p>Select a topic by clicking on a block. 
                        The block shows the top 5 words representing each topic.</p>
                      <h5>Document:</h5>
                        <p>The panel allows you to query a document by entering a number and clicking “Display.” 
                        The number you enter must be within the range shown after "Document Status." 
                        You will see that this range decreases as the number of rounds increases,
                        indicating that you are zooming in on the corpus.
